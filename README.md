The previous website for pyparsing was hosted on the Wikispaces free wiki, which has been discontinued.

This repository replicates content archived from that site.

_[Note: many of these entries are fairly old, and predate many new features of pyparsing,
and are predominantly coded using Python 2.
They are captured here for historical benefit, but may not contain
the most current practices or features. We will try to add editor
notes to entries to indicate when discussions have been 
overtaken by development events.]_

[The automated converter/loader from the wikispaces markup
has done a "best-effort" job at converting these entries to
markdown, but there are still a number of remaining tags and 
escapes to be cleaned up. Also, it appears that all the external
`http` links have been stripped, so I need to revisit the
original text to restore these.]
