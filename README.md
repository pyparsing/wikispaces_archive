The previous website for pyparsing was hosted on the Wikispaces free wiki, which has been discontinued.

This repository replicates content archived from that site.

[Note: many of these entries are fairly old, and predate many new features of pyparsing,
and are predominantly coded using Python 2.
They are captured here for historical benefit, but may not contain
the most current practices or features. We will try to add editor
notes to entries to indicate when discussions have been 
overtaken by development events.]
